# Self-Organizing Multiagent Systems final project

Project realized for the course *Self-Organizing Multiagent Systems* at *Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya*. 
 
 - Python implementation of the *Partaker-Sharer advising framework for multiagent reinforcement learning* (PSAF, [link to the paper](https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2019/pdfs/p2324.pdf)) .
 - Algorithm tested in a Predator-Prey scenario, by considering a grid-world environment
 - As a first step, we implemented the simple Q-learning algorithm for the single-agent case; we then moved to the case of 2 predators, where we implemented and tested the PSAF framework, proposed in the paper, and we compared it to the case of multiple independent Q-learners
 - Learning perfomed in 2 cases: with moving prey and with fixed prey
 
 The folders [one_agent](https://github.com/denaldo98/SOAS_project/tree/main/one_agent) and [two_agent](https://github.com/denaldo98/SOAS_project/tree/main/two_agent) contain the actual python implementation of the Reinforcement Learning algorithm. 
 More details to run and understand the code are provided in the [instructions_readme](https://github.com/denaldo98/SOAS_project/blob/main/instructions_readme.pdf) file.

The [report](https://github.com/denaldo98/SOAS_project/tree/main/report) folder contains the *pdf* of the report and also the presentation slides. 
The provided [report](https://github.com/denaldo98/SOAS_project/blob/main/report/SOAS_project%20_report.pdf) contains a detailed description of the project, with all the performed steps, comparisons and drawn conclusions.
