CASE OF 2 AGENTS WITHOUT COMMUNICATION:
--> epsilon starts from 0.1 and decreases:
    -epsilon decay rate = 0.001 or 0.0001??




Q-table initiialization?? --> all zeros




check if the state is initialized always the same (e.g. check pred initialization at each episode of different processes, seed problems???)

2 times initialization in case of first visit of state


--Q-learning update in all cases?



check bad initialization????




CHECK SIMULATION IN CASE OF 2 AGENTS WITH PSAF BUDGETS (FIND A WAY TO SET BUDGETS TO ZERO)







TRY TO PLOT BUDGETS AND TG INCREMENTALLY AS TRAINING PROCEDES
